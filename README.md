TF2Pug - Steam Edition (SE)
===========================

TF2Pug SE is a Steam client version of the once popular #tf2pug channel
on the GameSurge IRC network.

It aims to provide an automated and fluid service for users to find somewhat
serious games with other likeminded gamers, so they can improve their skills.

Unlike #tf2pug, the number of concurrent matches is limited solely by available
servers, and there is no game info spam in the main pug chat room. Furthermore,
since the bot is tied directly into Steam, user management is significantly
simpler.

Dependencies
------------

TF2Pug SE depends on the SteamKit2 library, which can be found [here](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit)

TF2Pug SE is available under the [GPL 3.0 license](http://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-%28gpl-3%29)
